## Project Overview
The Internet Applications group project is a comprehensive, full-stack website that demonstrates proficiency in a variety of skills and tools necessary to create a functional website. These skills include but are not limited to Flask, HTML/CSS, Bootstrap, Jinja, Postman, JQuery, and AJAX. Our team successfully met all the requirements from the six phases outlined in the rubric created by Dr. Sami Alfattani, earning a perfect score of 100%.

## How To Run:
To view the website, simply open the index.html file on any browser.

## Phase 3.1 Updates
- added header and footer to mobiles.html and reqres-data.html and connected them with the rest of the webpages.
- implemented a white colored text on the navigation link in every page that the user is currently on.
- Reqres data will now display the users in cards with their respective emails.
- mobiles.html data are stored inside a container and styled.

## Functional Search Bar
- Use the search bar to search between any of the following: "home", "about", "contact, "users", or "mobiles".

## Introducing Flask with app.py and 404.html
Pre-requisite:
- download the virtual environment by typing "python -m venv env" in the terminal.
- download flask by typing "pip install flask" in the terminal.

How to run:
- Hit "run" on app.py
- all pages are requested by flask and applied together.
- 404 page added if user enters the wrong URL.
- about.html will fetch json data from postdata.py with the help of flask.

## Functional Flask email in contact
- Make sure you have 2fa on your gmail account and insert your gmail in app.py with an app password that you get from this link: https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords?rapt=AEjHL4MqsPJzvO0QMvFpbYvW0WkUJ3b2WcZ4u-QVRczvAbTKIKPi2unH4dPwhx4YhPnpD9hXC26G_4Yh5H-khRpKYCvT_xR24A
- Select app = "Mail".
- Select device = whichever device you're using.
- **Important:** Remove your email and password before committing any changes to the repository.
